     		<h1 class= "hap">The Seven Continents</h1>

		<h2 class="happ">There are Seven Continents in the World:<br>Asia<br>Africa<br>North America<br>South America<br>Australia<br>Antartica<br>Europe</h2>
	<h2 class="happy">Asia is the largest continent and covers one third of all the land on Earth. It is home to about two thirds of the world's people, living in 48 countries. China and India are the world's most populous countries, with around 1 billion people each. Asia stretches from the Arctic Circle in the north to the warm, tropical waters of the Indian Ocean in the south, to the Ural Mountains in the west and the Pacific Ocean in the east. The world's highest mountains, the Himalayas, are in Asia, as well as the highest plateau, the Tibetan Plateau. The Dead Sea is the world's lowest point on land. Asia is home to animals such as Asian elephants, tigers, and giant pandas.</h2>
	<h2 class="ha">Africa is the second largest continent after Asia. It lies between the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. To the north is the Mediterranean Sea and to the south is the Southern Ocean. The northern part is covered by Earth's largest desert, the Sahara. To the east is the world's longest river, the Nile. Africa has 54 countries, more than any of the other continents. These countries are home to some of the most ancient cultures in the world. Most people still work in farming, producing their own food. Africa has large animal reserves (parks) like the Serengeti, Masai Mara, and Kruger. The reserves are home to wildlife, such as lions, rhinos, zebra, and elephants.</h2>
	<h2 class="happy">North America is Earth's third largest continent. It is made up of the United States of America, Canada, and Mexico down to Panama, as well as the Caribbean islands. It has coasts on the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans and is connected to South America by land. North America has natural wonders like the Grand Canyon and Yellowstone National Park. Greenland, the world's biggest island, is also in North America, although it belongs to the European country of Denmark. The human made Panama Canal divides the continents of North and South America. Animals that are found in North America include the moose, raccoon, and bears.</h2>
    <h2 class="ha">South America is Earth's fourth largest continent. It stretches from just above the equator down to the Antarctic. It is connected to North America by land. The Amazon River runs through South America and is surrounded by the world's largest rain forest. The continent has rain forests, deserts like the Atacama, the world's driest desert, and the Andes, the world's longest mountain range. There are glaciers in the south. South America is divided into 12 countries. The largest country is Brazil. The potato originates in South America, along with chocolate, pineapple, and peanuts. South American animals include llamas, the capybara, which ist the world's largest rodent, and the Andean condor, which has the largest wingspan of any bird.</h2>
    <h2 class="happy">Australia, the smallest continent and one of the largest countries on Earth, lying between the Pacific and Indian oceans in the Southern Hemisphere. Australia’s capital is Canberra, located in the southeast between the larger and more important economic and cultural centres of Sydney and Melbourne.Australia is separated from Indonesia to the northwest by the Timor and Arafura seas, from Papua New Guinea to the northeast by the Coral Sea and the Torres Strait, from the Coral Sea Islands Territory by the Great Barrier Reef, from New Zealand to the southeast by the Tasman Sea, and from Antarctica in the far south by the Indian Ocean.Australia has been called “the Oldest Continent,” “the Last of Lands,” and “the Last Frontier.” 

</h2>
<h2 class="ha">Antarctica is the continent at the South Pole and it is almost entirely covered in ice. It is the fifth largest continent and is surrounded by the Southern Ocean. As the temperature in Antarctica can dip to below 112°F (-80°C), no one lives there all the time. No country owns Antarctica Scientists from 29 countries visit research stations to carry out experiments throughout the year. Despite the cold, Antarctica is home to animals such as penguins, seals, and seabirds.</h2>

<h2 class="happy">Europe is Earth's second smallest continent after Australia but it has one quarter of the world's population. Europe's western coast is on the Atlantic Ocean. There are 44 European countries,which have distinct ethnic languages. The climate groups ranges and from cold winters in Scandinavia to warm areas in the south, in countries like Spain and Italy. Europe is divided from Africa by the Mediterranean Sea. The Ural Mountains divide Europe and Asia, very but sometimes the two continents are described as one area called Eurasia.</h2>
